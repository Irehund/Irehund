## Featured Project — JobTrack

**[JobTrack](https://github.com/Irehund/JobTrack)** is a free, open-source desktop application I built to manage my own job search. It grew into a full-featured tool that I'm releasing publicly for other job seekers.

**What it does:**
- Searches USAJobs, Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Adzuna simultaneously
- Plots job locations on an interactive map with real commute time estimates
- Tracks every application with automatic milestone timestamping
- Built-in AI assistant for plain-English questions during your search
- Optional Google Sheets sync for cross-device access
- No telemetry, no backend — all data stays on your machine

**Tech stack:** Python, CustomTkinter, SQLite, REST APIs, OAuth2, PyInstaller
